## 🚀 About me
I’ve recently developed a strong interest in programming and software development.  
My goal is to build **useful, well-structured, and innovative applications** with a clear emphasis on **functionality before design**.

I prefer:
- working systems over visual polish  
- clarity over cleverness  
- steady improvement over shortcuts  

---

## 🧠 Mindset & principles
- 🧱 **Functionality first** — software must work before it looks good  
- ⚙️ **Stability before scale** — predictable behavior beats fast growth  
- 🧭 **Learning by building** — real projects over tutorials  
- ✂️ **Simplicity over complexity** — fewer moving parts, clearer intent  

---

## 🔧 What I’m working on
- App and product-oriented development
- Turning ideas into small, working prototypes
- Building a solid technical foundation step by step

---

## 🛠 Tech (growing stack)
- Git & GitHub
- App development fundamentals
- More tools added as projects mature

---

## 📌 Current goal
Create a small number of **well-defined projects** that demonstrate:
- clear structure
- thoughtful decisions
- steady progression over time
